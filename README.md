# flutter_todoApp


Welcome to the TODO app readme page.
On this page I will show you how to use the application if needed so let's go.

Introduction:
In this app I used the flutter provider to give the results that you can see in the screenshots, however, there were a lot of challenges during the app creation.

Some Tips:
. The app will provide a dummy 3 tasks list that you can check and uncheck.
. The small add button is for adding a task to the list.
. The app should add the task automatically after the user presses the add button.
. To delete a task you need to hold on to the task for a couple of seconds and it will be deleted.
